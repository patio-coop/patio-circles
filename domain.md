# Domain

A Circle's DOMAIN is its domain of authority. When a Child Circle is created, the members of the Parent Circle must consent to what authority they are delegating to the Child Circle. Anything that isn't delegated to a Child Circle is the responsibility of the Parent Circle.

It is important that if there are multiple Child Circles, that their DOMAINs have clear boundaries, otherwise the responsibilities may overlap.

Also, it is important that if the parent circle does not want to get involved in too many decisions, that the DOMAINs of the child circles sufficiently cover what the Parent Circle wants to delegate.
