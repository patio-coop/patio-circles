# COORDINATOR

The job of the COORDINATOR of a circle is to support and make sure the Circle is still headed towards its [AIM](aim.md).

Importantly, the COORDINATOR does NOT make decisions for the Circle. The Members of a Circle must all consent to a decision.

The COORDINATOR simply supports and keeps the Circle on track.
