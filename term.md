# TERM

A TERM is simply a period of time that a Proposal or Circle has before it is reviewed for effectiveness.

All decisions should have a TERM associated with them. This makes it much easier for Members of a Circle to consent to passing the proposal.

Circles themselves should also have TERMS. After a TERM is completed, the Parent Circle should be given an opportunity to review the Child Circle and determine if it is still useful in fulfilling its AIM.

At the end of a TERM, the Members of a Circle (for Proposals) or the Parent Circle (for Child Circles) can of course consent to keeping the Proposal or Child Circle in place if it is fulfilling the AIM intended.
