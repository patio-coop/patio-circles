# SCRIBE

The job of the Circle's SCRIBE is to record relevant information that is important to the Circle.

For instance, the SCRIBE may take notes during a meeting, or record decisions that have been consented to by the Circle.

This could include the creation of Child Circles, keeping track of TERMS for Circles or Proposals, etc.
