Documentation of Patio's Sociocratic Circles

Patio uses a loose and informal version of [Sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy)

The "root" decision-making body is called the [Member Circle](member_circle.md) and consists of all the members of Patio: [list members here]

The Member Circle created a child [Coordination Circle](coordination_circle.md) to handle the coordination of meetings and projects.

The Member Circle created a child [Community Landing Page Circle](community_landing_page_circle.md) to handle the development of a landing page for Patio.

The Community Landing Page Circle created 3 child circles to take on the work of creating the site: a [Design Circle](design_circle.md), a [Content Circle](content_circle.md), and a [Technical Circle](technical_circle.md)
